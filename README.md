# Cheat_Quiz_Game
This is my first spontaneous project that i create. This program's used to solve some kind of quiz game automatically that display on monitor. By using image-to-text technology to scan the question and indicate the answer that saved in a json file through key-value. It can search in the question warehouse having around 500 question within 2 second.
