# Cheat_Quiz_Game
This is my first spontaneous project that i create. This program's used to solve some kind of quiz game automatically that display on monitor. By using image-to-text technology to scan the question and indicate the answer that saved in a json file through key-value. It can search in the question warehouse having around 500 question within 2 second.
# Instruction:
Step 1: Allocating all required position by draging and dropping, it will have 6 points total (8 in somecase,base on position of four questions). A is for Choice#1, B is for Choice#2 , Ques_TL is the position of top-left corner of question frame, Ques_BR is for position of bottom-right. Do the same for frame contain four questions.
Step 2: Press Enter or Button "Enter here" to get the answer.
Step 3: Programme automatically move the cursor to the right-answer, this step will take at least 1,5 second to 2,5 second.

* You also can save all cordinates in cordinates.json for saving time for next time . The questions that don't exists in question-warehouse will capture and save temporary in temp.txt, check to get question and to questions.json along with correct answers.
